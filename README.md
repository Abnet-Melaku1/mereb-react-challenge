# Project Name: Data Fetching Tab with React

This project was created by **[Abnet Melaku](https://abnet-portfolio.vercel.app/)** as a **test project given by Mereb Technologies**. It demonstrates data fetching from the [Loripsum API](https://loripsum.net/) and showcases a simple, responsive tab interface built with React.

> **Note**: Deployment is currently limited due to a **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue** with the Loripsum API, which restricts access from external domains. This affects the ability to host the project online, so it is recommended to run the project locally for full functionality.
